Besides, Ticketflap has another cool brand, Clockenflap Hong Kong art and music festival. Before joining Ticketflap, I worked in Alvanon, HK, whose main projects are related to fashion area.

                        In addition, I am interested in Data Analysis and Machine Learning, self-taught related knowledge including deep leaning, although I am still learning and practicing both. I believe that data exploring and ML will make our life easier and save our time to enjoy time with faimily.
